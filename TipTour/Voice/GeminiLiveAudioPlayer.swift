//
//  Streams PCM16 24kHz audio chunks (Gemini Live or OpenAI Realtime) to the
//  speakers in real time. Owns an AVAudioPlayerNode but NOT an AVAudioEngine
//  — the session passes in a shared engine so mic capture and playback both
//  run on the same engine. That's a hard requirement for Apple's voice
//  processing (AUVoiceIO) AEC to work: the audio unit needs to see both
//  uplink (mic) and downlink (speaker) on the same engine to subtract
//  speaker bleed from the mic input.
//
//  Why not AVAudioPlayer: it requires a complete audio file. Realtime APIs
//  stream audio in ~40ms chunks over the WebSocket — we need to queue each
//  chunk for playback the instant it arrives.
